# Two Sum

- https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

## Expected Behavior

- Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Approaches

- Brute Force
  - [Nested while loop](#nested-while-loop)
  - [Nested for...range loop](#nested-for-range-loop)

**1. Failed Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        res = 0
        a = 0
        b = a + 1
        while res != target:
            while a < len(nums) - 1:
                while b < len(nums):
                    res = nums[a] + nums[b]
                    if res == target:
                        return a, b
                    else:
                        res = 0
                    b +=1
                    if b == len(nums):
                        a += 1
                        b = a + 1
```

**Reason for failure**

- if the target is not found, it leads to an infinite loop

2. refactored code:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        a = 0
        b = a + 1
        while a < len(nums) -1:
            while b < len(nums):
                if nums[a] + nums[b] ==target:
                    return a, b
                b += 1
            a += 1
            b = a + 1
```

### Nested for range loop

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        for a in range(len(nums-1)):
            for b in range(a + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[a] + nums[b] == target:
                    return a, b

```

**Note**:

```python
for a + 1 in range(len(nums))
```

- below is invalid python syntax. You need to specify a variable that will hold the current value at each step of the iteration. "a+1" is not a valid variable name

<span style="color: red; font-size: 20px">## Why is for range loop faster than while loop?</span>

- The primary reason is that for loops in Python are usually faster than equivalent while loops. This is due to the internal implementation of these constructs in Python. When a for loop begins to execute, Python gets the entire sequence (in this case, generated by range()) in memory at once and then iterates over it. This can be faster than the while loop, which evaluates the condition in each iteration.
