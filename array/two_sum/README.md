# Two Sum

- https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

## Expected Behavior

- Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Approaches

- Brute Force
  - [Nested while loop](#nested-while-loop)
  - [Nested for...range loop](#nested-for-range-loop)
- [Hash Table](#hash-table)

### Nested while loop

**1. Failed Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        res = 0
        a = 0
        b = a + 1
        while res != target:
            while a < len(nums) - 1:
                while b < len(nums):
                    res = nums[a] + nums[b]
                    if res == target:
                        return a, b
                    else:
                        res = 0
                    b +=1
                    if b == len(nums):
                        a += 1
                        b = a + 1
```

**Reason for failure**

- if the target is not found, it leads to an infinite loop

**2. Refactored code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        a = 0
        b = a + 1
        while a < len(nums) -1:
            while b < len(nums):
                if nums[a] + nums[b] ==target:
                    return a, b
                b += 1
            a += 1
            b = a + 1
```

### Nested for range loop

<span style="display: inline-block; background-color: blue; border-radius: 800px; padding:2px; color: white;">

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        for a in range(len(nums-1)):
            for b in range(a + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[a] + nums[b] == target:
                    return a, b

```

**Note**:

```python
for a + 1 in range(len(nums))
```

- below is invalid python syntax. You need to specify a variable that will hold the current value at each step of the iteration. "a+1" is not a valid variable name

<span style="color: red; font-size: 20px">Why is for range loop faster than while loop?</span>

- The primary reason is that for loops in Python are usually faster than equivalent while loops. This is due to the internal implementation of these constructs in Python. When a for loop begins to execute, Python gets the entire sequence (in this case, generated by range()) in memory at once and then iterates over it. This can be faster than the while loop, which evaluates the condition in each iteration.

### Hash Table

**1. Failed Code: 1**

```python
    class Solution:
        def twoSum(self, nums, target):

            diff = 0

            for i in range(len(nums)):
                diff = target - nums[i]
                if diff > 0 and diff in nums:
                    return i, nums.index(diff)
                diff = 0
```

**Reason for failure**

- The main issue here is that you're checking if diff is in nums, which means you're not excluding the current number nums[i] from the possibilities.
- [3,2,4], 6
- [3,3], 6

**1. Failed Code: 2**

```python
    class Solution:
        def twoSum(self, nums, target):
            hashMap = []

            for i in nums:
                diff = target - i
                if diff > 0 and diff in hashMap:
                    return nums.index(i), hashMap.index(diff)
                hashMap.append(i)
```

**Reason for failure**

- cannot account for: [3,3], 6 => 0,0

**2. Refactored code:**

```python
    class Solution:
        def twoSum(self, nums, target):
            hashMap = {}

            for i in range(len(nums)):
                diff = target - nums[i]

                if diff in hashMap:
                    return [hashMap[diff], i]

                hashMap[nums[i]] = i
```

<span style="color: red; font-size: 20px">Points to consider</span>

- [0,0], 0
- [-3, 3], 0
- [3, -3], 0
- 어짜피 정수의 차이를 구하는거니까 absolute value 걱정하지 않아도 됨. (생각해보면 당연한거임 => 그래프 만들어 보셈!)
